Based on the plugin "Decorative Caps" by Pianosteve. 

This plugin requires Organize Series by Darren Ethier (2.4.6 has been tested but other versions should work). It serves no purpose without it. If you need decorative caps functionality without series, use the Decorative Caps plugin by Pianosteve.

NOTE: Maximum 10 series.  

Tested with Organize Series 2.4.6 and WP-PageNavi 2.8.5.
