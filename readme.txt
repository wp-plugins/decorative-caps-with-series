This is based on the plugin "Decorative Caps" by Pianosteve. 

This plugin requires Organize Series by Darren Ethier (2.4.6 has been tested but other versions should work). It serves no purpose without it. If you need decorative caps functionality without series, use the Decorative Caps plugin by Pianosteve.

== Description ==

The first letter of a post is modified as specified in the corresponding CSS class. This works even in posts that are split up into pages (e.g. Wp-PageNavi).  

The options page allows you to specify the CSS class name for each series. You add the CSS class(es) to your theme's CSS file.

NOTE: Assumed that each site has 10 or fewer series.  

To format the initial letter of each post in a series, you must:
    * specify a CSS class name for each series on the options page
    * create the CSS class in your theme's stylesheet.   

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'decorative-caps-with-series' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Specify the class name for each series on the options page. 

NOTE: '' is the default value. Nothing will happen if you leave the field for a series untouched. 

4. Add the class definition(s) to your theme's CSS file.
